This may be a code for a substance or pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse reaction risk (e.g., \"Latex\"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g., \"Latex allergy\"), or a general or categorical negated statement (e.g.,  \"No known allergy\").  Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'.  If a receiving system is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.\r\n\r\nA provider SHALL include it in the instance and a consumer SHALL record this in its consuming system.
